This is my project using a soil moisture sensor to alert the user when their plant needs watering in a slightly agressive way after learning plants make sound inaudible to the human ear.


I have included the development proccess in the included video however have not been able to solder or 3d print components due to spending the most part of the past year in hospital, therefore it is only a prototype at this stage.
